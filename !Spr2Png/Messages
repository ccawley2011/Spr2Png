WOpt0.0:Tick this option if, if the sprite is 32bpp, it has a built-in alpha channel.
WOpt0.1:Tick this option if the alpha channel is to be interpreted as inverse.

WOpt1.2:Enter the X scaling here, or leave blank to default to the Y scaling or 1:1.
WOpt1.4:Enter the Y scaling here, or leave blank to default to the X scaling or 1:1.
WOpt1.6:Enter the Artworks rendering level here (useful values are 0, 5, 10, 11), or leave blank for the default.
WOpt1.7:Tick this option if the output sprite is to have a mask.
WOpt1.8:Tick this option if the output sprite is to be anti-aliased and is to have an alpha mask or, if no mask, be background blended.
WOpt1.9:Tick this option if the output sprite is to have a wide mask.

WOpt2.0:\Stoggle whether spr2png/draw2spr is verbose.|M\Ato set the level of verbosity.
WOpt2.1:Tick this option if the operation is to be performed in single-tasking mode.

WOpt3.0:Tick this option if the output PNG is to be interlaced.
WOpt3.2:Enter the background colour here (hex BBGGRR format).|MIf blank, then the background is transparent (or white).
WOpt3.3:This icon displays the chosen background colour.|M\Sopen the colour picker.
WOpt3.5:Tick this option if you want masked or blank edges to be trimmed from the output image.

WOpt4.0:Tick this option if you want to try to create a 8bpp paletted PNG.
WOpt4.1:Tick this option if you want to try to reduce the alpha channel (if present) to a simple mask or to discard it if it's unused.
WOpt4.2:Tick this option if you want to sort the palette (of a paletted PNG), most used first.
WOpt4.3:Tick this option if you want to try to pack the paletted or greyscale PNG into less than 8bpp.
WOpt4.4:Tick this option if you want to try to convert the image to greyscale.

WOpt5.1:Tick this option if you want to control the row filtering to try for greater compression.
WOpt5.2/WOpt5.3/WOpt5.4/WOpt5.5/WOpt5.6:Tick this option if you want to allow this filter type.
WOpt5.7/WOpt5.8:This controls the maximum compression token length.|MHigher values are normally better.
WOpt5.9/WOpt5.10:Click on these arrows to alter the maximum compression token length.
WOpt5.11/WOpt5.12:This shows the compression strategy.|MThe default strategy is usually best.
WOpt5.14/WOpt5.15:This shows the compression level.|MFull (maximum) compression is usually best.
WOpt5.16/WOpt5.17:Click on these arrows to alter the compression level.

WOpt6.1:Enter the creation gamma setting here, or leave it blank to use any local defaults.|MFor the default RISC OS display, this is 0.5.
WOpt6.3:This shows the rendering intent for the image: none, perceptual (pictures), relative (logos), saturation (graphs, charts), absolute (proofing).
WOpt6.5:Tick this option to have the gamma and chromaticity chunks set appropriately for the rendering intent (unless the intent is default).
WOpt6.6:Tick this option to set chromaticity values for white and the primary colours.
WOpt6.7:Enter the chromaticity value pair for the image's white point here.
WOpt6.8:Enter the chromaticity value pair for the image's red channel here.
WOpt6.9:Enter the chromaticity value pair for the image's green channel here.
WOpt6.10:Enter the chromaticity value pair for the image's blue channel here.
WOpt6.11:\Sopen a menu which contains some chromaticity default chromaticity value pairs.

WSaveSpr.2:¤WSave.2
WSaveSpr.5:Tick this option if the PNG is to be rendered on a coloured background.
WSaveSpr.6:Enter the background colour here (hex BBGGRR format).|MAny value present here will override the PNG's defined background colour (the default is white).
WSaveSpr.7:¤WOpt3.3
WSaveSpr.8:Tick this option if you want to take into accout the image's gamma value.
WSaveSpr.9:Enter the image gamma value here (>0, <=10).|MAny value present here will override the PNG's defined gamma value (the default is 1/2.2).
WSaveSpr.11:Enter the display gamma value here (>0, <=10).|MThe default is 2.2.
WSaveSpr.12:Tick this option to cause any transparency information to be completely ignored.
WSaveSpr.13:Tick this option to create a separate mask (except where the mask is simple).
WSaveSpr.14:Tick this option if you want to reduce the alpha channel (if present) to a simple mask.
WSaveSpr.15:Tick this option to invert the values used for the alpha component.
WSaveSpr.16:Tick this option if the output sprite is to have a 1bpp mask.
WSaveSpr.17:Tick this option if the output sprite is to have a wide mask.
